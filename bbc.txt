Australia is to provide 8,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Papua New Guinea as the island nation struggles with an outbreak of coronavirus.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the doses would be sent immediately, along with other critical care equipment.

On Monday, Papua New Guinea warned its infection rate was approaching one in every three or four people.

The country's fragile healthcare system is under huge strain.

During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Morrison said the doses - from Australia's own stocks- would be used to vaccinate health workers.

He also said that he had lodged a request with AstraZeneca and the European Union to access one million of the country's contracted doses, "not for Australia, but for PNG, a developing country in desperate need of these vaccines".

It's unclear when these vaccines would be delivered.

Earlier this month, Italy blocked 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia on the basis that they were more urgently needed in Europe.

Infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake, from the Australian National University, told the BBC that Australia's 8,000 doses would prove helpful, even though it can only protect 4,000 people.

"You can't possibly achieve herd immunity this way, but if they're used for healthcare workers and maybe any excess reserved for vulnerable groups, it'll still be helpful," he said.

Papua New Guinea's first batch of vaccines were set to arrive in April as part of the global Covax inoculation sharing scheme but experts warned this would be too late.

More than half of the nation's 2,269 cases so far have been reported in the past month alone, and hospital wards in the capital Port Moresby are nearing capacity.
